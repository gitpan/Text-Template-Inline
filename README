NAME
    Text::Template::Inline - Quick and easy formatting of data

SYNOPSIS
     use Text::Template::Inline;

     # yields "\nReplace things and stuff.\n"
     render {
        foo => 'things',
        bar => 'stuff',
     }, <<'END';
     Replace {foo} and {bar}.
     END

     # yields "Three Two One Zero"
     render [qw/ Zero One Two Three /], '{3} {2} {1} {0}';

     # for a blessed $obj that has id and name accessors:
     render $obj, '{id} {name}';

     # a "fat comma" can be used as syntactic sugar:
     render $obj => '{id} {name}';

     # it's also possible to traverse heirarchies of data,
     # even of different types.
     # the following yields "one two three"
     render {
        a => { d => 'one' },
        b => { e => 'two' },
        c => { f => [qw/ zero one two three /], },
     } => '{a.d} {b.e} {c.f.3}';

     # you can use a different key path separator as well,
     # the following also yields "one two three"
     local $Text::Template::Inline::KEY_PATH_SEP = qr/::/;
     render {
        a => { d => 'one' },
        b => { e => 'two' },
        c => { f => { g => 'three' }, },
     } => '{a::d} {b::e} {c::f::g}';

DESCRIPTION
    This module exports a fuction "render" that substitutes identifiers of
    the form "{key}" with corresponding values from a hashref, listref or
    blessed object.

    The implementation is very small and simple. The small amount of code is
    easy to review, and the resource cost of using this module is minimal.

  EXPORTED FUNCTION
    There is only one function defined by this module. It is exported
    automatically.

    render ( $data, $template )
        Each occurrence in $template of the form "{key}" will be substituted
        with the corresponding value from $data. If there is no such value,
        the substitution will not be performed. The resulting string is
        returned.

        If $data is a blessed object, the keys in $template correspond to
        accessor methods. These methods should return a scalar when called
        without any arguments (other than the reciever).

        if $data is a hash reference, the keys in $template correspond to
        the keys of that hash. Keys that contain non-word characters are not
        replaced.

        if $data is a list reference, the keys in $template correspond to
        the indices of that list. Keys that contain non-digit characters are
        not replaced.
